What is this about ?
====================

It's a mini-mod that makes the Training skill tree full since level 1, so you'll only have to spend points in the other trees: Swordsmanship, Alchemy and Magic.



Cool, what more ?
=================

Nothing. It's just that.



What if I already spent some poits in the Traning Tree ?
========================================================

It'll complete the tree for free. No points refunded.



How do I install it ?
=====================

1. Go to the game's directory;
2. There you'll find a folder named "CookedPC", open it;
3. There rename "base_scripts.dzip" to something else for backup purposes;
4. Copy the "base_scripts.dzip" from this mod's package to the same place mentioned above;
5. Done.



How do I remove it ?
====================

Go the other way around of the install instructions above.

1. Delete the modified "base_scripts.dzip" inside ".../Witcher 2/CookedPC";
2. Rename back the original "base_scripts.dzip";
3. Done.
